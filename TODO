* delete record/observation
* maybe with some modifications to Derailleur:
  - clever pruning when finding:
    - when path is a directory and there is no node, prune
    - when path is a directory but there is a node, continue
  - cache observation structs somewhere in the db or in the observer
* fiber-friendly batch operations
* register on inotify events
